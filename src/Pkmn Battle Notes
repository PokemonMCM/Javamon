Data is calculated by the PkmnArena, where it is sent to clients through PkmnArenaMove.
PkmnArena takes PkmnPlayer's sent by clients and uses the methods built in to calculate things like damage dealt, damage taken, and stat modifiers
The base damage and attacker's relevant stats are sent to the PkmnArena where it gets the defender's relevant stats, calculates damage, and sends the info to the defender
All important info is stored on the PkmnArena. It's only sent to clients so they can decide their next move and see what happened.

Clients send Properties with data on their Pokemon for each member of their party.
